Projected Sea Level Rise in Boston, Massachusetts - 2100
--

Overview
This project visualizes the potential impacts of rising sea levels on Boston, Massachusetts, by the year 2100. The map illustrates how sea level rise could affect the city's coastal areas, infrastructure, and communities. By presenting multiple sea level rise scenarios, this project aims to inform and engage urban planners, local government officials, environmental organizations, and the general public.

By visually highlighting areas that could be affected by sea level rise, this map hopes to promote awareness and inspire action.

Data Sources
The map is created using the following datasets:

NOAA 2022 Sea Level Rise data for the state of Massachusetts: NOAA SLR Data
Sea level rise projections from mass.gov: Mass.gov SLR Projections
Map Representation
The map uses an isoline technique to represent multiple sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100. Different shades of blue indicate varying levels of sea level rise based on the following projection scenarios:

Conservative (~2ft)
Moderate (~5ft)
Extreme (~10ft)
Landmarks and points of interest that would be underwater in these scenarios are highlighted with point labels.

Tools Used
ArcGIS: For mapping and spatial analysis.
Adobe Illustrator: For refining the map, labels, and other design elements after initial creation in ArcGIS.
